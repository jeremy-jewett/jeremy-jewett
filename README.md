- 👋 A little more: 

Hi, everyone!  Thank you for stopping to look at my page.  I'm wrapping up my deep-dive into machine learning and data science through Lambda School.
I have come a long way from where I was.  Always working behind a computer, working with the applications that my company built (and seeing how they could be better) has pushed me to where I am today. Beyond the professional realm, I'm looking to develop an application on my own time to enhance the iRacing platform.  A few of the skills that I have picked up are:
- Building machine learning models
- Deployment of applications to the world wide web
- A whole lot of Python

Reach out to me, and let's get something done!
